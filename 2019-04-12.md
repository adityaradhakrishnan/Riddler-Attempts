### Finding all the transitive champions in the NCAA

> On Sunday, the Baylor Lady Bears won the 2019 NCAA women’s basketball championship, and on Monday, the Virginia Cavaliers did the same on the men’s side. But what about all of the unsung transitive champions? For example, earlier in the season, Florida State beat Virginia, thereby laying claim to a transitive championship for the Seminoles. And Boston College beat Florida State, claiming one for the Eagles. And IUPUI beat Boston College, and Ball State beat IUPUI, and so on and so on.

> Baylor, meanwhile, only lost once, to Stanford, who lost to five teams, and so on. How many transitive national champions were there this season in the women’s and men’s games? Or, maybe more descriptively, how many teams weren’t transitive national champions? You should include tournament losses in your calculations.

### Solution

To solve this problem, I took an approach where we simply filtered the input data to only get the games where our transitive champions "lost" and then added those winners to the list of transitive champions. I then repeated this step until there was no additional winning teams that were not already in the list of transitive chapmions. This is accomplished by simply running the code the following command `Rscript --vanilla 2019-04-12/get_champions.R {input_file.tsv}`. This will not only find the complete set of transitive champions, but then assign them a "champion degree" which is the fewest number degrees from which they're removed from the initial championship and generate a nifty visualization of how the number of transitive champions increase with increasing degree. Among the teams in the NCAA women's championship, 1775 out of 2020 are transitive champions (or 87.87% of teams are transitive champions) and only 245 schools are not.

Given the wide field of teams, there's a very weak correlation between the championship degree and the overall win percentage. Among teams in the NCAA men's championship, 359 out of 668 are transitive champions (or 53.74% of teams are transitive champions) while 309 scools are not.

Interestingly, in this case, there is a much stronger correlation between win percentage and order of championship. Nevertheless, in either case, it does appear the most "worthy" candidate won!7yg
