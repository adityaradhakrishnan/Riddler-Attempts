### Does Your Gift Card Still Have Free Drinks On It? 

> Lucky you! You’ve won two gift cards, each loaded with 50 free drinks from your favorite coffee shop, Riddler Caffei-Nation. The cards look identical, and because you’re not one for record-keeping, you randomly pick one of the cards to pay with each time you get a drink. One day, the clerk tells you that he can’t accept the card you presented to him because it doesn’t have any drink credits left on it. What is the probability that the other card still has free drinks on it? How many free drinks can you expect are still available?

### Solution

In the general case where you have *n* credits on each card, you require *n + 1* trasactions to completely drain the card. Subject to this constraint, the other card can then be used *m* times, where *m* is, at most, *n* times. To see how this works in a toy case, let's consider *n = 2*. That means, the first card will have been used for the third time and we can consider the likelihood of the remaing card having 2, 1, or 0 credits remaining.

#### 2 credits remaining (m = 0):

(1/2)^3 * (1/2)^0 * (3!)/(3!) = 1/8

That is to say, 1/8th of the time, the first card is fully spent without using the second even once.

#### 1 credits remaining (m = 1):

(1/2)^3 * (1/2)^1 * (3!)/(2!) = (1/2)^4 * 3 = 3/16

Or, a 3/16ths of the time, the second card will have been used once and there will be one credit remaining.

#### 0 credits remaining (m = n = 2):

(1/2)^3 * (1/2)^2 * (3!)/(1!) = 6 * (1/2)^5 = 3/16

Finally, 3/16ths of the time, the second card will have been used twice and there will be no credits remaining. At this point, we note that the probabilities only add up to 0.5. This is because we've only accounted for the case where finish off the first card. When you consider the (symmetric) case where the second card is used up first, we get the total distribution of remaining balances on the "other" card when the "first" card is used up.

For this particular case, a quarter of the time, the "other" card will have both credits, 3/8ths of the time, the card will have 1 credit, and finally the remainig 3/8ths of the time, the card will have no credits. Thus, the probability of the card having free drinks is 5/8ths, ad the expected number of free drinks is 7/8th of a drink.

Based on this toy model we can see what the general formula for this problem is for probability of having any drinks left on the other card:

And the expected number of remaining drinks is:

Thus, going back to the original problem statement, when we consider the case where *n = 50*, the probability of having some credits on the "other" card is 92.04% and the average number of drinks remaining will be 7.04.
