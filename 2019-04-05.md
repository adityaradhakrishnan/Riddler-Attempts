### Does Your Gift Card Still Have Free Drinks On It? 

> Lucky you! You’ve won two gift cards, each loaded with 50 free drinks from your favorite coffee shop, Riddler Caffei-Nation. The cards look identical, and because you’re not one for record-keeping, you randomly pick one of the cards to pay with each time you get a drink. One day, the clerk tells you that he can’t accept the card you presented to him because it doesn’t have any drink credits left on it. What is the probability that the other card still has free drinks on it? How many free drinks can you expect are still available?

#### Solution

In the general case where you have *n* credits on each card, you require *n + 1* trasactions to completely drain the card. Subject to this constraint, the other card can then be used *m* times, where *m* is, at most, *n* times. To see how this works in a toy case, let's consider *n = 2*. That means, the first card will have been used for the third time and we can consider the likelihood of the remaing card having 3, 2, 1, or 0 credits remaining.

3 credits remaining (m = 0):

(1/2)^3 * (1/2)^0 * (3!)/(0! * 3!) = (1/2)^3

That is to say, 1/8th of the time, the first card is fully spent without using the second even once.
