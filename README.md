## Riddler Attempts

Attempts to solve various questions posed in the 538 Riddler section. Each problem gets its own directory and supporting code. As this often requires rendering of mathematical symbols, I'm using [readme2tex](https://github.com/leegao/readme2tex) which will compile LaTeX syntax in Readme files to PNGs/SVGs stored in the repository (as opposed to the more common solution of using images hosted/rendered via [CodeCogs](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php)).
